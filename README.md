# 🌿 Pulse: Transparent Carbon Credit Issuance Using IOTA

**Pulse** is a decentralized platform that allows organizations and individuals to transparently register carbon-saving projects, log their environmental activities (like tree planting or solar installation), and simulate carbon credit issuance. Each action is cryptographically anchored on the **IOTA Tangle** (Testnet), ensuring data integrity, transparency, and tamper-resistance.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌱 **Register Projects** — e.g., afforestation, clean energy installations  
- 📝 **Log Carbon Activities** — e.g., planting trees, reducing emissions  
- 🌐 **Anchor to IOTA Tangle** — immutable, decentralized logging on the IOTA Testnet  
- 🎟️ **Simulate Carbon Credit Issuance** — mimic real-world credit generation  
- 🧾 **Verifiable Logs** — All activities are traceable and viewable via message IDs

## 🔗 How IOTA is Used

Pulse integrates with the **IOTA Stardust Testnet** using the `@iota/sdk` library. All key activities—like project registration, carbon activity logging, and simulated credit minting—are written as messages to the **IOTA Tangle**.

Each message contains:
- Project ID
- Description of activity
- Timestamp
- Optional simulated credit amount

✅ These messages can be verified on [iotascan.com/testnet](https://iotascan.com/testnet).
